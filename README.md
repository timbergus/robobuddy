# RoboBuddy

A 2D drone to play with BeagleBone Blue robotic platform.

## NMEA Parse

This is a library written in C/C++ v.1z, to parse NMEA messages for a five bucks GPS connected to a [BeagleBone Blue](https://beagleboard.org/blue) card.

The idea. Create a 2D drone (a drone on wheels), to follow a simple path between waypoints.

To execute the project just `./run.sh`. There is an example downloaded from Internet of a GPS record file, that load a line every second and returns position data parsed.
